# SettleCore checkpoint — 2026-10-10

## Durable creation attempt timestamps — 2026-10-10
- HTTP recovery separately pushedf375b0d; lookup16fff80 CI green. Compile RED then3 PostgreSQL GREEN cases for immutable per-payment first creation attempt. INSERT ON CONFLICT preserves first timestamp across retry/restart/concurrent calls; FK requires existing payment; no payment/intent side effects or sensitive payload.
- Additive migration20261010105446_AddPaymentProviderCreationAttempts and snapshot reviewed: new table with payment identity/start timestamp only, restrictive FK; no existing data edits. Infrastructure107 passed; full Release build zero warnings/errors. Latest full429 before3 added cases.
- Next: application retry-age guard (23h conservative Stripe window, stale/future attempts blocked before outbound calls), DI and focused HTTP/unit proof, full verification, operations docs. Backend only.

## Stored-reference HTTP recovery — 2026-10-10
- Lookup adapter separately pushed16fff80; readiness4145a29 CI green. HTTP behavioral RED405 then GREEN for neutral stored-payment lookup handler and GET /payments/{id}/provider-payment. Disabled/missing/unlinked404, correlation mismatch409 without secret. Successful response no-store; SDK GET exact stored intent, no new creation POST. Lookup observations never mutate local payment/intent/audit.
- All3 provider-flow tests passed; full Release429 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors.
- Next remaining safety gap: unlinked orphan after provider success/reference-storage failure can be retried beyond Stripe idempotency retention. Persist first creation attempt before outbound call and bound automatic retries; stale attempts require explicit reconciliation, never fresh blind creation. Then operations docs/final verification. User explicitly backend-only.
- Quota last35% short-window/33% weekly remaining.

## Neutral provider lookup and Stripe adapter — 2026-10-10
- Readiness separately pushed4145a29. Compile RED then7 GREEN transport cases for separate neutral lookup request/port and Infrastructure-only Stripe retrieval adapter. GET uses stored reference; identity metadata, reference, amount, currency and explicitly configured mode must match before returning response-only secret/status. Wrong provider rejected before I/O. No local success mutation.
- Reuses existing status normalization; no SDK/core coupling. Infrastructure104 passed; full Release build zero warnings/errors. Latest full422 before7 added cases; no HTTP/DI lookup wiring yet.
- Next: stored-payment lookup application/HTTP path with no-store secret and missing/unlinked404; then recovery end-to-end and operations docs. Backend only.

## Truthful module readiness — 2026-10-10
- Posting-worker CI repair68187d190f6162e92224acea530309fcf30b58fe; GitHub run38045974781 green before resuming feature edits. User clarified backend-only continuation.
- Real HTTP RED showed readiness200 for unavailable/unmigrated databases. GREEN registers scoped, timeout-bounded checks for Payments/Ledger/Reconciliation connectivity and pending migrations; generic failure messages, no exception/connection data in health result. Liveness excludes dependencies.
- PostgreSQL tests verify503 until all three schemas applied,200 after migrations,503 after ledger stopped and liveness200 throughout. Focused2 passed; full Release422 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: neutral provider lookup and Stripe retrieval verifying identity/reference/amount/currency/mode, response-only secret with no-store; then operations documentation. No frontend per user.

## Posting worker startup CI repair — 2026-10-10
- CI forbf6d77c exposed same framework cleanup mismatch in existing posting-worker PollIntervalMilliseconds invalid-setting host assertion. Latest533e16d CI happened to pass; fragility remains reproducible in CI logs.
- Extracted unchanged production posting-worker options/host registration into API extension. Host behavioral assertion accepts startup failure;3 exact OptionsValidationException/type/message cases resolve production options registration deterministically.
- Focused configuration20 passed; full Release422 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. No payment behavior changed. Readiness RED tests saved temporarily outside checkout until repair pushed; then resume truthful database/schema readiness.

## Client-secret response cache protection — 2026-10-10
- Complete flow proof separately pushed73fa8cf. Focused behavioral RED: provider creation response had no Cache-Control; GREEN sets no-store before successful response serialization. Secrets remain response-only.
- All3 creation/end-to-end tests passed; full Release build zero warnings/errors. Latest host111/full418 checks precede this header-only change.
- Next: backend readiness currently registers no dependency checks; add truthful PostgreSQL/schema readiness while preserving dependency-free liveness, then operations documentation.

## Complete provider-to-ledger acceptance proof — 2026-10-10
- HTTP composition separately pushedbf6d77c; application09276ad CI green.
- Test-only slice extends PostgreSQL/real SDK fake transport coverage through explicit account provisioning, HTTP preparation+provider creation, invalid signed evidence rejection, valid signed receipt, automatic authoritative success and posting, and replay. Single balanced3-entry transaction uses exact caller transaction/ledger/account IDs and34 minor-unit fee; no creation-response success side effects.
- Focused E2E1 passed; full host module111 passed; full Release build zero warnings/errors. Latest full aggregate418 before this added test. No production changes in this slice.
- Next: no-store client-secret response header RED/GREEN, then provider-flow operations/limitations documentation and remaining backend hardening.

## Provider creation HTTP composition — 2026-10-10
- Neutral use case separately pushed09276ad. Focused HTTP behavioral RED (missing route) then2 GREEN tests with PostgreSQL and actual Stripe SDK over isolated fake transport; no live provider request.
- POST /payments/{id}/provider-payment checks enabled Stripe before resolving provider; disabled/missing payment404, missing preparation/already-linked409. SDK receives stored amount/currency/identity key and metadata; returned reference persisted before200/client secret. Creation reports Succeeded in test while local payment remains Pending and no intent/audit is created. Linked replay rejected before another provider call.
- Full solution418 passed, zero failed/skipped; Release build zero warnings/errors. No migration or fee/account defaults; secrets remain response-only. Next: complete creation→signed webhook→receipt worker→posting worker→balanced ledger E2E proof, then small operational hardening/documentation.

## Neutral provider creation use case — 2026-10-10
- Hosted worker pushed5360960; GitHub run38041762088 green.
- Focused compile RED then10 GREEN cases for neutral CreateProviderPaymentHandler. Stored pending/unlinked payment and matching persisted explicit preparation required before provider call; amount/currency/idempotency come from stored payment. Creation observations, including Succeeded, never complete local payment. Reference persisted through existing concurrency-safe port before returning client secret; provider/persistence failures do not report success. Existing linked/completed payments rejected before outbound creation.
- Payments unit142 passed; full Release build zero warnings/errors. Latest full aggregate406 before these10 tests; no unverified aggregate claimed. No DI/HTTP wiring yet, migration, SDK/core dependency, frontend or fee defaults.
- Next: opt-in HTTP provider creation composition with fake transport-backed PostgreSQL tests for preparation prerequisite, response secret, reference persistence and unchanged Pending status; disabled endpoint must not resolve provider.
- Quota last79% short-window/39% weekly remaining.

## Hosted provider receipt worker — 2026-10-10
- CI repair separately pushed as 1ad7d4b878fcc51b2800d3547c47d9d5c36be6b8; GitHub run38041390161 green before feature edits.
- Focused compile RED for missing options, then PostgreSQL behavioral RED: signed durable receipt stayed unprocessed. Minimal GREEN adds default-disabled hosted worker invoking existing scoped retrying processor; explicit enabled Stripe/test-live mode and positive batch/poll/retry settings required. Shutdown leaves durable receipts; batch failures retry on next poll.
- Signed HTTP test verifies automatic correlated success, single posting intent and audit. Focused15 passed; full solution406 passed, zero failed/skipped; Release build zero warnings/errors. No migrations, SDK in core, accounting defaults or frontend.
- Next: neutral provider creation application use case requiring persisted explicit posting preparation, then HTTP composition with safe response/reference persistence and no authoritative success from creation observations.

## CI repair — 2026-10-10
- Inspected clean main at f4da386; fetched origin and confirmed latest CI failure was Stripe startup exception mismatch for empty WebhookSecret.
- Host test now asserts invalid enabled configuration prevents startup regardless of cleanup exception; five deterministic production DI/options cases assert exact OptionsValidationException, options type and validation failure. No production behavior changed.
- Focused Stripe tests13 passed; CI-equivalent Release restore/build/full tests succeeded399 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. Separate repair commit follows; GitHub CI must be green before feature work.
- Next: default-disabled provider event worker with validated positive settings and enabled Stripe/explicit mode, then signed HTTP-to-automatic success/intent/audit proof. Architecture and explicit posting-input constraints preserved.

## Current handback — 2026-10-10 near quota threshold
- Stopped starting implementation at14% remaining; latest observed11% short-window/44% weekly remaining. Final full solution completed394 passed, zero failed/skipped; latest full build zero warnings/errors. No unfinished source/test/migration changes; documentation-only closing commit contains this checkpoint. Exact closing SHA in workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md and Git.
- Latest implementation committed/pushed `cdaef06ecab5a4d2b520b7ad4825eb212d8cb7c1`. Nine separate verified slices from baseline `03421b13930fd40a933fff51094d5fb79615dbef`: `9ad8304` signed HTTP ingress, `de7cbcf` neutral correlation, `04fcf8f` preparation storage, `a6dab11` preparation API, `547041d` atomic receipt completion, `0a5dc9a` concurrency-safe reference writes, `32095cd` manual bypass guards, `d1e967e` inbox due/retry schedule, `cdaef06` scoped retrying batches.
- Signed receipt ingress awaits durable inbox before200; matching retries200, invalid signature/mode400, conflict409, storage failures never200. Receipt alone does not change status. Preparation uses explicit caller transaction/ledger/account IDs and exact positive fee; stored amount/currency; no fee/routing defaults. Correlated processing atomically saves success+intent+audit+ProcessedAt; worker dispatch remains separate.
- Apply new migrations `20261010021835_AddPaymentLedgerPostingPreparations` and `20261010023409_AddProviderEventRetrySchedule` in addition to earlier inbox migration before using these paths. Stripe default disabled with explicit validated settings. Manual /succeed blocked when Stripe enabled; provider-linked application manual completion rejected. Reference-only conditional writes preserve concurrent success and immutable reference.
- Next smallest RED: default-disabled PaymentProviderEventWorker with positive validated operational settings, requiring enabled Stripe/explicit mode; signed HTTP-to-automatic authoritative success/intent/audit PostgreSQL test. Then worker GREEN, host/module/full checks, build, separate commit/push. Batch processor is available but not hosted yet, so automatic inbox processing is not wired. After worker, neutral provider creation use case/HTTP path requiring persisted explicit preparation; SDK creation currently exists only as Infrastructure adapter.
- No frontend, deployment, live Stripe calls or credentials added. Account-wide ChatGPT memory editing and automatic UI switching unavailable. Durable continuity: this tracked file and workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md. Ignored verification logs preserved in settlecore-evidence/2026-10-10; build artifacts remain ignored.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 scoped provider receipt batches
- Durable retry migration separately committed/pushed `d1e967e16f4ab3bbfc1a168ebc4ece1e3b530c59`.
- Focused compile RED then real PostgreSQL batch GREEN. Selection bounded by provider/due time; each receipt gets separate scoped transaction. Missing prerequisites and exceptions schedule explicit future retry; processing/scheduling errors logged with event identity, no raw payload/client secret. Invalid/early receipt cannot starve valid following receipt at batchSize1.
- Infrastructure97 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution393 before this batch slice. This commit contains processor/checkpoint; exact SHA in workspace handoff after push.
- Next smallest RED: validated default-disabled hosted worker requiring Stripe enabled and explicit mode, with signed HTTP receipt automatically producing authoritative success/intent/audit. Provider creation application/HTTP wiring remains afterward; no frontend/live external provider calls.
- Last visible18% short-window/45% weekly remaining; stop new changes near10%. Tracked checkpoint/workspace handoff provide memory, account-wide memory/UI switching unavailable.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 durable provider inbox retry schedule
- Manual provider completion guards separately committed/pushed `32095cd018deb52f3e83290dae8ff023ad644387`.
- Focused compile RED then three PostgreSQL GREEN cases for neutral bounded/provider-scoped due selection and explicit UTC retry scheduling. Exact due boundary included; future receipts excluded; missing/processed scheduling no-op; concurrent acknowledgment/scheduling cannot revive receipt. Atomic completion clears due time with ProcessedAt.
- Additive migration `20261010023409_AddProviderEventRetrySchedule` adds nullable next_attempt_at and pending due index; retains existing index/receipts. Apply before updated processor/worker. Generated migration adapted to existing static-array analyzer convention.
- Infrastructure96 passed; full solution393 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. This commit contains retry repository/migration/checkpoint; exact SHA in workspace handoff after push. No unfinished source changes at commit.
- Next: opt-in retrying inbox batch processor and hosted worker, with signed HTTP-to-authoritative-success proof and deferred/invalid-event scheduling checks. Provider creation application/HTTP wiring remains next afterward; no frontend/live provider calls.
- Last quota27% short-window/47% weekly remaining. Stop new slices near10%; durable tracked checkpoint/workspace handoff, no account-wide memory/UI switching.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 manual provider-completion bypass protection
- Reference-only persistence separately committed/pushed `0a5dc9ae1d51d5236bab9798b75acadcabd6d39e`.
- Focused two unit and one HTTP behavioral RED then GREEN. Both manual application handlers reject provider-linked payments before status changes/writes. Stripe-enabled HTTP /succeed returns409 before reading payment state, protecting the period before provider reference persistence. Disabled/manual non-provider workflow retains existing behavior.
- Payments unit132 and host96 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution387 before this guard slice; no unverified aggregate claimed. This commit contains guards/checkpoint; exact SHA recorded in workspace handoff after push.
- Next: neutral durable inbox due selection/retry schedule, then opt-in hosted processing worker. Then provider creation use case can be connected without manual HTTP success bypass or reference-update status regression.
- Last quota36% short-window/48% weekly remaining; finish green slices, stop new work near10%. Durable tracked checkpoint/workspace handoff; account-wide memory/UI switching unavailable.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 concurrency-safe provider reference attachment
- Atomic receipt completion separately committed/pushed `547041d02d69e5d883f573d96bfa303911051814`.
- Behavioral PostgreSQL RED reproduced three failures: stale Pending snapshot overwrote concurrent Succeeded status, reference replacement was allowed, conflicting concurrent writes both succeeded. Minimal GREEN adds neutral reference persistence port and conditional reference-only UPDATE; handler uses it rather than whole-payment Update. Matching replay succeeds; different reference conflicts, one concurrent winner. Existing cross-payment uniqueness still returns409.
- Four focused tests GREEN; full solution387 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors. Existing unit/HTTP fakes implement the neutral reference port. No migration. This commit contains fix/checkpoint; exact SHA in workspace handoff after push.
- Next: provider-mode manual-success protection, neutral inbox retry selection/scheduling and opt-in processing worker, then neutral provider creation use case. Preserve status under reference persistence; authoritative receipt processor is the only provider completion route.
- Quota last43% short-window/49% weekly remaining. Durable checkpoint/workspace handoff only; no account-wide memory or automatic UI switching.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 atomic authoritative receipt completion
- Preparation API separately committed/pushed `a6dab11aa293d9f307d22093da768fde3b3762f4`.
- Focused compile RED then14 PostgreSQL GREEN cases for neutral event-processing contract and Infrastructure transaction. Locks receipt then payment, validates stored reference/identity/amount/currency/explicit mode, requires immutable explicit preparation, and commits payment success+Pending dispatch intent+IntentRecorded audit+receipt ProcessedAt together.
- Matching replay preserves first ProcessedAt. Concurrent same/distinct events serialize and retain one intent/audit. Missing receipt/payment/reference/preparation stays unprocessed; early missing-reference delivery processes after local reference arrives. Mismatched evidence cannot authorize success. Forced receipt update failure rolls all success writes back and retry succeeds. EF payment materialization uses ordinary mapped query after scalar row lock to preserve optional complex reference mapping.
- Infrastructure89 passed; full solution383 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors. No new migration/worker/frontend/external calls. This commit contains processor/checkpoint; exact SHA in workspace handoff after push.
- Next: retry-aware opt-in worker to process durable inbox; protect provider-linked payments from manual success bypass; provider creation must persist reference without regressing status under concurrent webhooks. Existing reference attachment overwrites whole tracked payment and needs a focused concurrency repair before connecting provider creation.
- Quota last57% short-window/51% weekly remaining. No account-wide memory/UI switch; tracked file/workspace handoff are durable continuity.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 explicit preparation API
- Preparation repository/migration separately committed/pushed `04fcf8f20533420f6e651d72501363e1c4ffa8b5`.
- Behavioral HTTP RED404 then GREEN for POST /payments/{id}/ledger-posting/preparation. Neutral application handler validates explicit transaction/ledger/account IDs and fee through existing factory using stored amount/currency. Returns validated complete request, persists immutable preparation only; no status change/intent/audit write.
- Real PostgreSQL HTTP case verifies invalid input400 without writes, missing404, matching replay200, conflicting inputs409 and Pending status. Host module95 passed, zero failed/skipped; full solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution368 before this endpoint slice; no unverified aggregate claimed.
- This commit contains endpoint/use case/checkpoint; exact SHA in workspace handoff after push. No unfinished source changes at commit.
- Next: neutral event-processing contract and PostgreSQL transaction correlating stored receipt/payment/preparation before atomic payment success + intent + audit + receipt ProcessedAt. Missing prerequisites remain pending; concurrency/replay/rollback must be tested before worker wiring.
- Last quota65% short-window/53% weekly remaining; tracked checkpoint/workspace handoff continuity only, no account-wide memory or automatic UI switch.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 durable posting preparation
- Neutral correlation separately committed/pushed `de7cbcfd461650c8691996eec820badbf924ada1`.
- Focused compile RED then four PostgreSQL GREEN cases, plus existing-payment FK check. Neutral repository stores the immutable complete explicit posting payload in separate preparation table. Identical/concurrent replay succeeds, different transaction/routing/amount/fee/currency preserves one winner and conflicts. No payment status, dispatch intent or audit event changes.
- Additive migration `20261010021835_AddPaymentLedgerPostingPreparations` adds preparation table keyed by payment with restrictive FK; apply before using preparation. Infrastructure-only persistence entity; neutral application payload/contract.
- Payments Infrastructure75 passed; full solution368 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. This commit contains repository/migration/checkpoint; exact SHA recorded in workspace handoff after push. No unfinished source changes at commit.
- Next smallest RED: application/HTTP prepare endpoint validates explicit inputs against stored amount/currency, persists preparation and retains Pending. Then atomic correlated inbox processing and worker wiring. Preparation must never itself authorize payment success.
- Durable memory uses tracked checkpoint/workspace handoff; account-wide memory/UI switching unavailable. Last quota73% short-window/54% weekly remaining.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 neutral success correlation
- Signed HTTP ingress committed/pushed separately as `9ad8304aa6a96edea508d77e6d84c5bce116f0de`.
- Focused compile-time RED then GREEN for provider-neutral stored payment correlation. Eleven new cases require matching payment identity, stored provider and reference, exact amount at established currency precision, ordinal normalized currency and explicit expected mode. Missing reference/mismatches reject; unsupported currency cannot authorize success. Validation never changes status.
- Payments unit module 130 passed; full solution 363 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. This commit contains correlation and checkpoint, exact SHA in workspace handoff after push; no unfinished source edits.
- Next: PostgreSQL-backed immutable preparation of caller-supplied posting request while payment remains Pending, then atomic authenticated inbox completion using stored evidence/reference/preparation. No hidden accounts, fees or defaults.
- Durable continuity in this tracked file and workspace handoff; account-wide memory/UI switching unavailable. Last visible quota82% short-window/55% weekly remaining.

## Earlier slice — 2026-10-10 signed HTTP ingress
- Resumed actual clean main `03421b13930fd40a933fff51094d5fb79615dbef`, independently matched GitHub. Older sibling SettleCore checkout was not used. Fresh baseline 344 tests passed, zero failures/skips.
- Focused behavioral RED: seven HTTP cases returned 404; disabled case passed. GREEN: eight HTTP tests including real PostgreSQL durable receipt, identical replay, conflicting evidence, signature/mode rejection, unrelated signed event, unavailable storage and disabled ingress.
- POST /payments/webhooks/stripe reads unchanged raw body, verifies through neutral decoder, checks explicit mode and awaits scoped durable inbox before 200. Invalid signature/mode 400, conflicting replay 409, disabled 404; storage exceptions cannot return 200. No SDK types entered core; no local success or ledger writes triggered by receipt.
- Full solution 352 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors. No schema/frontend/live Stripe changes. Existing inbox migration required before enabling ingress. Snapshot event API version must match the pinned SDK. Official contract: https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.
- This commit contains the slice and checkpoint; exact final SHA recorded in workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md after push. No unfinished implementation at commit.
- Next smallest slice: neutral stored-payment success evidence correlation (identity, stored provider reference, exact minor-unit amount/currency and explicit expected mode), then durable explicit accounting preparation and atomic authoritative inbox processing. Never infer accounting accounts or fees.
- Continuity uses this tracked checkpoint and workspace handoff; account-wide memory editing and automatic mode switching unavailable. Quota visible last 90% short-window/56% weekly remaining; keep observing approximately 10% stop threshold.

## Historical handback — 2026-10-09 user-requested stop
- User explicitly requested stopping at the next commit and returning control to chat. No further implementation slice started. Closing documentation commit contains this checkpoint; final exact SHA is in workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md and Git.
- Latest implementation committed/pushed: `2182bb9fcf296808386918026b9deb6e9a9e9167` opt-in Stripe configuration/DI. Prior slices: `fe1dfaa` identity, `105107f` neutral contract, `f4aed62` adapter, `ca45826` decoder, `5e35891` durable inbox.
- Last full solution: 337 passed, zero failed/skipped after inbox migration. Latest changed host module: 86 passed including seven new configuration tests; final full solution build zero warnings/errors. No fresh full-solution run after configuration slice; do not present 344 as a verified full run.
- Stripe selected and implemented behind neutral Payments boundaries. Signed success decoding and durable inbox are verified but not connected to an HTTP endpoint or local success processing. Explicit posting-input preparation and stored provider-reference/amount/currency/mode correlation remain required. No frontend, deployment or live Stripe calls.
- Apply `20261009033110_AddPaymentProviderEventInbox` before enabling ingress. Stripe disabled by default; explicit API key, webhook secret, positive SignatureToleranceSeconds and IsLiveMode required. No credentials committed.
- Next smallest RED: opt-in POST /payments/webhooks/stripe persists authenticated raw-body delivery before 200, matching replay 200, invalid signature/mode 400, conflicting event 409, storage failure never 200. Then preparation/correlation and atomic authoritative success processing; do not infer accounts or fee policy.
- Repository clean before this documentation edit; no unfinished implementation changes. Clean primary checkout will fast-forward to final pushed commit, with verified result recorded in workspace handoff.
- Durable continuity: this tracked file and workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md. Account-wide memory editing and automatic UI mode switching unavailable. Visible quota 29% short-window/59% weekly remaining; stopping at user request, not quota.

## Historical handback — 2026-10-09 lifecycle audit complete
- Fresh baseline was clean main `4b2b3b21312895dc29e5b1b6d15c0450da3fe588`, independently verified against GitHub; full baseline 289 passed.
- Working mirror: `/Users/suthankan/.codex/.chatgpt-projects/g-p-6a87d9fd8d408191ab054e1d87dc13d6/SettleCore-current`. Primary `/Users/suthankan/Desktop/Projects/SettleCore` inspected clean at baseline; fast-forward after final push, with exact result in workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md.
- Separate pushed slices: first acknowledgment time `bbc4068`, intent-recorded event `0e549f2`, atomic acknowledgment event `7707f9e`, atomic retry event `6376466`. Closing status-response/test slice is this commit; exact SHA from git and workspace handoff.
- Final solution 296 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. No unfinished source changes at commit. No frontend changes.
- Durable memory: this tracked checkpoint plus workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md. Account-wide ChatGPT memory editing and automatic normal-chat mode switching are unavailable.
- Quota visible: last observed 72% short-window, 65% weekly remaining; not near approximately 10% threshold. Stopping at missing provider contract, not quota.

## Current behavior and operating requirements
- Explicit caller-supplied transaction/ledger/account IDs and fee in minor units; stored payment amount/currency. No merchant configuration or fee formula invented.
- Succeeded payment, immutable Pending posting intent and IntentRecorded event save atomically. Matching retries retain original event; conflicting or concurrent inputs retain one winner or return conflict.
- Dispatch writes Ledger before acknowledgment, with stable exact replay identity. Pending→Posted/first PostedAt/PostingAcknowledged event commit in one PostgreSQL statement. Replay preserves timestamp and event. PostedAt means acknowledgment time, not exact Ledger write time.
- Successful retry scheduling appends RetryScheduled atomically with its explicit UTC next-attempt time. Missing/Posted scheduling does nothing; event failure rolls back the state update. Concurrent scheduling/acknowledgment cannot revive Posted.
- Events contain IDs, kind, occurrence time and optional retry due time. Application appends, with restrictive intent FK and unique one-time event index. No DB-role immutability policy, actors or retention rule configured. No historical backfill invented; historical PostedAt/events remain unknown.
- Existing GET /payments/{id}/ledger-posting now exposes nullable PostedAt alongside status/identity/NextAttemptAt. Reads do not append events or dispatch. No event-history HTTP endpoint added.
- New migrations: `20261009030228_AddPaymentLedgerPostingAcknowledgmentTime` adds nullable posted_at; `20261009030614_AddPaymentLedgerPostingEvents` adds event table/FK/indexes only. Apply both before running updated API/worker.
- Worker remains opt-in and disabled by default. Provision explicit supplied Ledger accounts and apply Payments/Ledger migrations before enabling. Positive operational settings validated at startup; metrics have no deployed exporter.

## Next intended small slice / blocking dependency
- Payment-posting lifecycle audit scope was explicitly selected by user and is implemented/tested. Provider ingestion/webhooks next require an actual provider and its event/signature/idempotency contract; requested asynchronously, no response yet. Do not invent provider schemas/signatures.
- Once supplied, inspect official provider contract, define one smallest backend ingestion RED test, implement minimal GREEN, focused then broader verification, commit/push separately and checkpoint. Keep backend before frontend.
- Broader audit actors/retention, audit-history API, observability exporters, deployment and remaining backend roadmap are not claimed complete. No external deployment performed.

## 011.8D hosted worker closing slice
- PostgreSQL assertion RED captured: HTTP success persisted intent but it remained Pending without a worker. GREEN with enabled hosted worker completes it automatically and retains one balanced Ledger transaction with three entries.
- Added validated opt-in worker options, cancellation-aware polling, batch failure logging/retry, TimeProvider/batch DI and default disabled configuration.
- Host factory explicitly replaces both database contexts so the end-to-end test uses its separate isolated stores.

## Historical checkpoint — 2026-09-27

## Current position
- Active repository: `/Users/suthankan/Desktop/Projects/SettleCore`, branch `main`.
- 011.3C committed/pushed as `6f247da`: Ledger handler registration and Payments-owned port adapter DI.
- 011.4A committed/pushed as `baafb06`: exact positive decimal-to-long minor units with explicit precision; no rounding.
- 011.4B already committed/pushed as `77b3221` when this session started: Payments currency policy supports SGD=2, JPY=0, KWD=3, case normalization, no fallback.
- 011.4C committed/pushed as `6413d63`: `PaymentAmountConversion.ToMinorUnits(decimal, string)` composes the currency policy and exact converter. 16 new tests cover precision, lowercase, fractional units, invalid currency, null, nonpositive and overflow amounts.

- 011.5A committed/pushed as `957787b`: Ledger repository treats matching transaction IDs/ledger/entry multisets as idempotent; different contents throw LedgerTransactionConflictException. PostgreSQL unique-key races reload the winner and detach the failed insert. No schema change.

- 011.5B (this checkpoint-containing commit): ledger HTTP endpoint returns 409 on conflicting transaction identity; identical retries retain the existing 201/location response without duplicate writes.

## Verification
- 011.4B baseline: 205 solution tests passed.
- 011.4C: compile-time RED confirmed; then 221 solution tests passed, zero failures/skips, including PostgreSQL Testcontainers. Full solution build: zero warnings/errors.

- 011.5A: four PostgreSQL RED tests then GREEN, including deterministic concurrent writers, reversed entry order, same-context repeats, conflicts and context reuse. Full solution: 225 passed, no failures/skips; build zero warnings/errors.

- 011.5B: PostgreSQL HTTP test RED (500 instead of 409), then full solution 226 passed, zero failures/skips. Build zero warnings/errors; diff check clean.

## Architecture and next slices
- Preserve .NET 10/C#14 modular monolith, Minimal APIs, module-owned DI and EF/PostgreSQL. Backend and tests before frontend/deployment.
- Payments owns IPaymentLedgerPostingPort and PaymentLedgerPostingRequest; Payments Infrastructure adapts to Ledger PostPaymentLedgerTransactionHandler.
- Payment.Amount remains decimal; Ledger uses integer minor units. Currency-aware conversion is available but success integration remains unwired.
- MarkPaymentSucceededCommand carries only PaymentId; handler marks/saves status only. Accounting routing and authoritative fee source are not defined. Do not invent either.
- USER DECISION CONFIRMED 2026-09-27: require explicit posting inputs from the caller (ledger/account routing and exact fee); do not invent merchant configuration or fee formulas.
- Next intended slice 011.6A: model explicit payment-success posting inputs and build a Payments-owned posting request from stored Payment.Amount/Currency using the currency-aware converter. Include stable caller-supplied TransactionId, LedgerId, the three account IDs and an explicitly unit-labelled fee. Validate without writing or changing payment status. Follow existing Ledger fee constraints; any change to zero-fee support is separate scope.
- Then add durable Payments-owned posting intent, uniquely keyed by payment, storing the complete immutable payload and stable transaction ID atomically with status in the Payments database. Add PostgreSQL rollback and concurrent retry/conflict tests before changing the success endpoint. Existing status-only handler must not call Ledger directly.
- After atomic success/intent persistence is verified, add dispatch/retry/completion semantics through IPaymentLedgerPostingPort. Ledger idempotency now handles matching/conflicting concurrent identities; protect against differing payloads for the same payment even when callers supply different transaction IDs.
- Repository retry protection is tested for current standalone SaveChanges usage. If wrapping Ledger writes in an explicit transaction later, verify isolation/savepoint recovery separately.
- Define durable posting intent together with success persistence before connecting stores; no independent status/posting writes.
- Remaining backend: payment-ledger integration, audit, provider ingestion, webhooks, workers/outbox/idempotency, observability. No frontend work performed.

## Commit and continuity
- User authorizes commit/push after each logical green slice to `https://github.com/Suthankan1/SettleCore.git`.
- Remote main pushed at `957787b` before 011.5B. This commit contains 011.5B and checkpoint; use git log for final hash.
- Current handback threshold: around 10% remaining, superseding 4%. Last observed: 14% short-window and 87% weekly remaining.
- Original chat: `6ab2b1a8-08b4-83ee-b497-fa1440530122` (C# .NET Project Idea).

## Handoff
- Autonomous work stopping at the verified 011.5B boundary near the capacity threshold; no uncommitted implementation work intended. Verify local HEAD/remote match after push.
- Completed this run: 011.4C `6413d63`, 011.5A `957787b`, and 011.5B (checkpoint-containing commit). 011.4B `77b3221` was already present and pushed.
- No payment-success-to-ledger wiring, outbox worker, provider ingestion, audit or frontend implementation added in this run.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.6D
- Baseline 011.6C: `873825f`, current source checkout clean at start.
- Working repository for this run: local project directory `SettleCore-current` (cloned from `/Users/suthankan/Desktop/Projects/SettleCore`). Original source checkout remains at the baseline.
- Added Payments-owned IPaymentLedgerPostingIntentRepository and minimal EF AddAsync/GetByPaymentIdAsync implementation, following existing repository conventions.
- Compile-time RED captured for missing repository types before implementation. PostgreSQL GREEN reloads the complete immutable payload through an independent context and checks missing payment returns null.
- Focused test 1 passed; Payments infrastructure 12 passed; full solution 239 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors.
- Docker Desktop was stopped; started successfully to enable Testcontainers.
- Next small step: repository DI registration with focused resolution test, then explicit atomic payment-success/intent boundary and PostgreSQL rollback tests. Standalone AddAsync follows existing SaveChanges conventions; atomic integration must use a shared transaction/boundary rather than independent commits.
- Posting inputs stay explicit; no accounting routing or fee policy invented. No frontend changes.
- This checkpoint is included in the 011.6D commit; verify final hash and push status with Git.

## 2026-10-08 — repository registration
- 011.6D committed and pushed: `35540b5`.
- Added scoped intent repository registration to AddPaymentsModule. Focused host integration test captured missing-service RED, then GREEN; verifies implementation type and same/different scope lifetime.
- Full solution 240 passed, zero failed/skipped. Build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: atomic payment-success + posting-intent persistence boundary, starting with PostgreSQL happy-path and rollback RED tests; then retry/conflict coverage before endpoint changes.
- Latest quota: 89% short-window and 92% weekly remaining; handback threshold not reached.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.6E atomic persistence foundation
- Repository registration committed/pushed as `3587e31`.
- Added IPaymentSuccessPersistence and EF implementation saving succeeded payment and pending intent in one SaveChanges transaction; no Ledger call and no endpoint change.
- Compile-time RED captured before implementation. Two PostgreSQL GREEN cases verify happy path and rollback of status when intent insertion fails with duplicate key.
- Payments infrastructure 14 passed; full solution 242 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: guard the boundary against mismatched payment/intent identity and invalid status, then matching/conflicting concurrent retries with database-backed tests before application/API wiring.
- This foundation deliberately does not yet provide retry semantics or DI registration. Keep old status-only flow disconnected from Ledger.

## 2026-10-08 — atomic boundary guards
- Atomic persistence foundation committed/pushed: `2288914`.
- Two PostgreSQL assertion RED cases demonstrated mismatched identities and pending status were accepted. Minimal guards now reject both before writing; independent read proves unchanged pending payment and no intent.
- Focused atomic tests 4 passed; Payments infrastructure 16 passed; full build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution: 242 passed before guards.
- Next: matching/conflicting retry semantics for atomic persistence, then deterministic concurrent database writers; do not wire endpoint until these pass.

## 2026-10-08 — sequential posting intent retries
- Boundary guards committed/pushed: `f55422a`.
- Added Payments-owned PaymentLedgerPostingIntentConflictException. Atomic boundary returns successfully for identical immutable posting payload; conflicts compare transaction ID, ledger/account IDs, currency, gross and fee independently.
- Compile-time RED captured for missing conflict type. Nine PostgreSQL GREEN cases cover same-context and fresh-context identical retries plus all eight changed payload fields; one original intent retained.
- Rollback test now forces a database length constraint failure, preserving true failed-write rollback coverage after duplicate handling changed.
- Focused atomic/retry tests 13 passed; Payments infrastructure 25 passed; full solution 253 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: deterministic simultaneous writers, matching and conflicting payloads; catch only the intent primary-key race, reload committed winner and clear failed tracked writes so context can be reused. No endpoint or dispatch wiring yet.

## 2026-10-08 — concurrent posting intent retries
- Sequential retry protection committed/pushed: `eaf5c2a`.
- Two deterministic PostgreSQL RED cases forced both writers past missing-intent lookup before SaveChanges; observed raw duplicate key failures.
- GREEN catches only PK_payment_ledger_posting_intents unique violation, detaches the failed payment/intent pair, reloads committed winner, then compares full immutable payload. Unrelated tracking is retained.
- Matching writers both succeed; conflicting writers have exactly one success and one Payments conflict. Both contexts can subsequently SaveChanges without replaying failed writes.
- Focused race cases 2 passed; Payments infrastructure 27 passed; full solution 255 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: application flow accepting explicit posting input, factory validation before status mutation, and one IPaymentSuccessPersistence call. Then DI and PostgreSQL endpoint tests; dispatch/completion later. Old status-only endpoint remains unchanged until that slice.
- SaveChanges implicit transactions verified; outer explicit transaction/savepoint usage is not covered and should not be introduced without separate tests.

## 2026-10-08 — explicit-input application flow
- Concurrent retry recovery committed/pushed: `2da1630`.
- Added RecordPaymentSuccessCommand/Handler accepting caller-supplied PaymentLedgerPostingInput. Uses stored amount/currency and established request factory; validates before status mutation; saves payment and full pending intent through one atomic boundary call.
- Succeeded retries avoid calling domain MarkSucceeded again and are checked by persistence. Missing payment returns null; invalid fee leaves pending status and makes no persistence call.
- Compile-time RED captured; four focused GREEN cases, all 101 Payments unit tests passed; solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 255 passed before this new handler.
- Application flow is not yet registered or exposed; old status-only handler/endpoint unchanged. Next: verify persisted-state consistency for pre-existing intent retries, then register application flow and require explicit posting body at success endpoint with PostgreSQL API RED tests.
- Quota last observed: 71% short-window, 89% weekly remaining.

## 2026-10-08 — persisted retry consistency
- Explicit-input application handler committed/pushed: `543f467`.
- PostgreSQL RED exposed false successful acknowledgment when identical intent existed but stored payment remained pending. Boundary now checks actual persisted payment success before acknowledging retries, and detaches unsaved status on pre-existing intent paths.
- GREEN confirms inconsistent pair is rejected and later SaveChanges cannot leak the attempted success. Focused 1 passed; Payments infrastructure 28 passed; solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 255 passed before application and this guard.
- Next: API body/DI wiring, with PostgreSQL success+intent round-trip, matching retry, changed-payload 409, missing body/invalid input 400 and missing payment 404 tests before dispatch work.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.6F explicit-input success endpoint
- Persisted-state consistency committed/pushed: `27186e1`.
- POST /payments/{id}/succeed now requires PaymentLedgerPostingInput JSON body and resolves RecordPaymentSuccessHandler/IPaymentSuccessPersistence through scoped module DI.
- PostgreSQL API assertion RED: missing body previously returned 200 and mutated status. GREEN validates missing/invalid body 400 without writes, missing payment 404, valid success and identical retry 200, changed transaction ID 409; independently reloads exact payload, one pending intent and succeeded payment.
- Existing HTTP tests now send explicit inputs; already-succeeded explicit retry is allowed. Old status-only application handler remains available but endpoint does not use it or directly call Ledger.
- Focused API suite 9 passed; host integration 63 passed; full solution 261 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: map amount conversion overflow to HTTP validation failure without mutation; then durable intent completion/dispatch semantics and retry after Ledger success but before acknowledgment. No accounting or fee defaults introduced.

## 2026-10-08 — amount overflow regression
- Explicit-input success endpoint committed/pushed: `ae06de7`.
- Added HTTP regression test for decimal.MaxValue conversion: already GREEN through existing converter validation. No production change required; pending status and no persistence call verified.
- All four focused success endpoint tests pass. Last full solution 261 passed; build clean at previous production slice.
- Next: Pending → Posted intent completion lifecycle, durable acknowledgment and application dispatch via existing Payments-owned port; prove failed posting stays pending and replay after Ledger success is idempotent.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.7A posting completion lifecycle
- Amount overflow regression committed/pushed: `37d0de0`.
- Added Posted status and idempotent MarkPosted transition; all posting identity/account/currency/amount fields remain immutable.
- Compile-time RED captured before adding lifecycle method/state; focused 2 passed, Payments unit 102 passed; solution build zero warnings/errors. No migration required: status already persisted as unconstrained string.
- Next: database-backed guarded acknowledgment (pending → posted, repeated acknowledgment safe, missing intent no write), then dispatch via IPaymentLedgerPostingPort and restart/replay tests.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.7B durable acknowledgment
- Completion lifecycle committed/pushed: `6ed1833`.
- Added repository MarkPostedAsync: guarded status-only database update, idempotent acknowledgment returns true, missing intent returns false. Reads use AsNoTracking so acknowledgment cannot be hidden by previously tracked pending objects.
- Compile-time RED captured before repository API. PostgreSQL GREEN verifies repeated/missing acknowledgment, fresh same-context reads, independent reload, all immutable payload fields preserved, later SaveChanges cannot revert completion.
- Payments infrastructure 29 passed; full solution 264 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: focused application dispatch RED tests for port success/failure, durable acknowledgment failure then retry with the same transaction ID, and missing/already-posted no-op behavior. Then real Ledger/PostgreSQL replay integration and pending worker queries.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.7C dispatch application semantics
- Durable acknowledgment committed/pushed: `e3fb39e`.
- Added DispatchPaymentLedgerPostingCommand/Handler. Missing intent returns false, posted intent returns true without port call; pending intent posts exact immutable payload, then durably acknowledges.
- Port/acknowledgment failures propagate and leave pending intent for replay using unchanged transaction identity; no cross-module transaction introduced.
- Compile-time RED captured. Four focused GREEN cases cover success/order/completed skip, both failure boundaries with retry, and missing intent. Payments unit 106 passed; solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 264 passed before dispatch.
- Dispatch not registered yet. Next: real composition/PostgreSQL test with separate Payments and Ledger stores, simulate failure after Ledger commit but before Payments acknowledgment, restart scope and prove one transaction/three entries plus posted intent. Then worker pending query and dispatch loop.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.7D real cross-store replay
- Dispatch application semantics committed/pushed: `080cb48`.
- Registered scoped dispatch handler. PostgreSQL composition RED captured missing registration; GREEN exercises actual Payments repository, Ledger adapter/handler/repository and separate database stores.
- Happy dispatch and failure after Ledger commit/before Payments acknowledgment both verified. Fresh-scope replay finishes pending intent; retains one transaction and exactly three correct balanced entries, stable transaction/ledger identities.
- Focused 2 passed; host integration 66 passed; full solution 270 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: bounded pending query for worker, followed by failure isolation/retry scheduling and hosted dispatch. Avoid starvation from permanently failing intents; no fee/account routing defaults.
- Latest quota observed: 44% short-window and 85% weekly remaining; stop new changes around 10% remaining.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.8A pending worker batches
- Cross-store replay composition committed/pushed: `5d7956a`.
- Added bounded ordered GetPendingAsync repository query, selecting pending intents only for committed succeeded payments. Posted intents, pending payments and orphan intents excluded; nonpositive limit rejected.
- Compile-time RED captured; PostgreSQL GREEN verifies bounds/order and all exclusions. Payments infrastructure 30 passed; solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 270 passed before query.
- Next: durable next-attempt scheduling with due filtering and an index, tested before hosted worker. Failed records must not monopolize the bounded queue. Operational retry delay remains configurable; accounting inputs stay explicit.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.8B durable retry schedule
- Pending worker query committed/pushed: `4ff8988`.
- Added nullable UTC NextAttemptAt, guarded ScheduleRetryAsync, due-time filtering with injectable TimeProvider, and status/next-attempt/payment index. Migration adds only the intent timestamp column and index; snapshot updated. Generated index array adjusted to satisfy strict analyzer.
- Compile-time RED captured. PostgreSQL GREEN verifies persisted schedule, exact due-time inclusion, fresh-context filtering, missing/posted scheduling false and no revival of completed intents.
- Payments infrastructure 31 passed; full solution 272 passed, zero failed/skipped; solution build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: bounded batch processor with fresh scopes per intent, configurable retry delay, failure isolation/logging and cancellation propagation. Then opt-in hosted worker configuration and full HTTP→worker→Ledger verification.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.8C failure-isolated batch processor
- Durable retry scheduling committed/pushed: `1bdf407`.
- Added PaymentLedgerPostingBatchProcessor: bounded selection scope, fresh async scope per intent, completed count, structured failure logging and persisted next-attempt scheduling. Retry delay is supplied explicitly; cancellation propagates without retry.
- Compile-time RED captured. PostgreSQL GREEN proves failing first intent does not block successful second, failed intent not reattempted before due, due retry completes, cancellation leaves all pending and no scheduling writes.
- Focused 2 passed; host integration 68 passed; full solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 272 passed before batch processor.
- Next: opt-in hosted worker with validated operational settings, default disabled until migrations/connections/accounts are configured; HTTP→automatic dispatch→separate Ledger DB test. Then checkpoint near 10% quota.
- Remaining backend beyond payment dispatch: audit, provider ingestion/webhooks, additional idempotency, observability and deployment still not completed. No frontend work.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.8E application status query
- Fresh baseline: mirror and primary checkout clean main at `506f299d8a2aebb5e1bb3b13803afbb555fcc9e6`; GitHub main independently verified identical. Fresh full solution baseline 275 passed, zero failed/skipped.
- Added read-only GetPaymentLedgerPosting query/result/handler exposing payment ID, stable transaction ID, Pending/Posted status and persisted NextAttemptAt. Missing intent returns null; empty identity is rejected. Cancellation flows to the repository; no write method is used.
- Compile-time RED captured before implementation. Payments unit tests 110 passed; full solution build zero warnings/errors.
- This application-only slice is committed separately. No DI or HTTP exposure yet; next small step is PostgreSQL HTTP RED coverage, then scoped registration and GET /payments/{id}/ledger-posting.
- Quota observed 34% short-window and 74% weekly remaining. Backend only; explicit accounting inputs remain unchanged.

## 2026-10-08 — 011.8E HTTP posting status
- Application query committed/pushed as `15f07ed`.
- Added scoped query registration and GET /payments/{paymentId}/ledger-posting. Response includes stable transaction ID, Pending/Posted status and raw persisted NextAttemptAt; 404 when no intent exists and 400 for empty payment ID.
- PostgreSQL HTTP assertion RED captured (404 instead of validation/lookup response). GREEN round-trips HTTP-created payment and explicit success intent, then persisted retry scheduling and completion, verifies identity/amounts retained. Read does not dispatch or write.
- Focused test 1 passed; full solution 280 passed, zero failed/skipped; solution build zero warnings/errors. No migration or frontend changes.
- Next: scheduling-failure isolation regression. A retry-schedule exception currently escapes the batch catch and prevents later intents from processing; prove failure with PostgreSQL-backed batch test before minimal fix. Preserve cancellation propagation.
- This checkpoint travels with the separate endpoint commit; exact hash from Git. Durable progress memory is this tracked file; account-wide ChatGPT memory editing is unavailable in these tools.

## 2026-10-08 — retry scheduling failure isolation
- Status endpoint committed/pushed as `4676f7b`.
- PostgreSQL-backed batch RED showed retry-scheduling exception aborting later intent processing. Minimal nested catch logs scheduling failure and continues; failed intent remains pending with unchanged schedule for replay.
- GREEN also verifies cancellation during scheduling propagates immediately without touching later intents, and a later healthy batch completes the retained intent.
- Focused batch tests 4 passed; host integration 72 passed; full build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 280 passed before these two additional host cases.
- Next: hosted worker restart regression with durable scheduled pending intent and no duplicate Ledger entries; then operational posting metrics. No frontend or invented provider contract.

## 2026-10-08 — hosted worker restart regression
- Scheduling isolation committed/pushed as `e59b2da`.
- Expanded actual HTTP/host/two-PostgreSQL-store worker test: missing supplied Ledger accounts causes durable delayed retry; dispose first host, provision those exact accounts, start fresh host and verify automatic completion and one balanced transaction/three entries.
- Test-first regression was GREEN on existing production code; no artificial RED or production change made.
- Focused worker tests 2 passed; host integration 73 passed; build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 280 passed before three new host cases.
- Next: operational counters for attempts/completions/posting failures/retry-scheduling failures using .NET metrics, with focused behavior RED before instrumentation. Quota last observed 22% short-window/72% weekly remaining.

## 2026-10-08 — posting operational counters
- Hosted restart coverage committed/pushed as `d901673`.
- Added IMeterFactory-managed SettleCore.Payments meter, singleton instrumentation and counters: settlecore.payment_posting.attempts, .completed, .failures and .retry_scheduling_failures. Added matching Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics 10.0.12 infrastructure dependency.
- Counters report processing outcomes, not unique financial transactions; concurrent/already-posted replays may count a successful outcome. No payment/account IDs or unbounded metric tags. Metrics are available to .NET listeners; no external exporter configured.
- Compile-time RED captured before instrumentation. PostgreSQL-backed listener verifies exact counters through failure/scheduling failure/recovery and excludes host cancellation from failure counters.
- Focused batch tests 5 passed before extra shutdown metric case; full solution 285 passed including both metric cases, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors.
- Next: verify disabled-by-default and invalid worker operational settings at actual host startup, then handoff near quota threshold. Durable audit remains a future backend slice; provider-specific ingestion still requires actual requirements.

## 2026-10-08 — worker configuration and closing handoff
- Metrics committed/pushed as `c5aa906`.
- Four actual-host tests verify default-disabled worker and startup rejection for invalid batch size/poll interval/retry delay. All GREEN immediately on existing validation; test-only slice.
- Final full solution 289 passed, zero failed/skipped; full build zero warnings/errors. No new migrations in this run, no frontend or accounting defaults.
- This checkpoint and configuration tests form the final separate commit. Verify exact HEAD/remote and clean primary fast-forward; workspace handoff stores final immutable SHA and verification evidence paths.

## 2026-10-09 — first posting acknowledgment evidence
- Baseline independently verified clean main/GitHub at `4b2b3b21312895dc29e5b1b6d15c0450da3fe588`; fresh baseline 289 passed.
- Focused compile-time RED captured for missing PostedAt, then PostgreSQL GREEN. Nullable posted_at records the first Pending→Posted acknowledgment atomically with status; replay/concurrent acknowledgment preserves the winner. Historical Posted rows remain null; no fabricated timestamps.
- Migration `20261009030228_AddPaymentLedgerPostingAcknowledgmentTime` adds only nullable timestamp column. Timestamp is acknowledgment time, not proof of the exact external Ledger write time.
- Payments infrastructure 33 passed; full solution 291 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. No frontend/accounting defaults. This checkpoint is included in the separate slice commit; exact SHA from git.
- User explicitly selected payment-posting lifecycle audit scope: intent recorded, retry scheduled, posting acknowledged. Next: durable append-only event records, with same-store atomic state/event writes and replay/concurrency/rollback tests.
- Durable memory remains this tracked checkpoint and workspace handoff; no account-wide memory editor or automatic mode-switch control available. Usage observed 92% short-window/69% weekly remaining before full verification.

## 2026-10-09 — durable intent-recorded lifecycle event
- Acknowledgment evidence committed/pushed as `bbc4068`.
- User-approved scope: payment-posting lifecycle events only. Added immutable event values/table with event identity, payment/transaction identity, kind, UTC occurrence and optional scheduled time. Restrictive intent FK; unique partial index for one-time intent/acknowledgment events; chronological lookup index. No actors, retention policy or historical backfill invented.
- IntentRecorded appended in the existing payment-success/intent SaveChanges transaction. Matching replay does not append. Unique-race handling detaches the failed event as well as payment/intent, preserving usable contexts and the winning event.
- Compile-time RED captured; 16 focused persistence/retry cases GREEN, then added audit-insert failure rollback test. Module 34 passed, zero failed/skipped; solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 291 before this one extra case; repeat after dispatch event integration.
- Migration `20261009030614_AddPaymentLedgerPostingEvents` creates only event table, FK and indexes. Application writes append events; this is not a database-role immutability/security policy.
- Next: atomic acknowledgment/retry events with PostgreSQL failure/replay/concurrency tests, then full-solution verification. No unfinished source changes at commit; exact SHA from git. Usage last observed 86% short-window/68% weekly remaining.

## 2026-10-09 — atomic posting-acknowledged event
- Intent-recorded audit committed/pushed as `0e549f2`.
- PostgreSQL behavioral RED: missing event on first/concurrent acknowledgment, and no failure on forced audit rejection. GREEN via one parameterized PostgreSQL UPDATE-returning/INSERT statement, committing status/first PostedAt/event together without cross-store transaction.
- Replays (including historically Posted rows) do not invent an event/time. Concurrent acknowledgments retain one winning timestamp and one event; audit failure leaves Pending/null PostedAt and healthy retry succeeds.
- Focused 3 passed; module 35 passed; full solution 293 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. No migration needed for this slice. Exact SHA from git; no unfinished source changes at commit.
- Next: RetryScheduled lifecycle events atomically with each successful schedule update, persisted explicit next-attempt time; verify failed audit rollback and no events for missing/Posted intents.
- Provider ingestion contract requested from user while independent audit work continues. No provider-specific assumptions or frontend work.

## 2026-10-09 — atomic retry-scheduled events
- Acknowledgment event committed/pushed as `7707f9e`.
- Two PostgreSQL behavioral RED cases then GREEN: each successful scheduling update appends RetryScheduled with UTC occurrence and exact normalized next-attempt time, in one parameterized UPDATE-returning/INSERT statement.
- Missing/Posted intents append nothing. Audit rejection preserves prior schedule/history. Added concurrency regression: racing retry/acknowledgment cannot revive Posted; audit events match successful state updates.
- Module 38 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 293 before these three added tests; repeat at next HTTP integration boundary. No migration/frontend/accounting policy change.
- Next: expose first acknowledgment time in existing read-only posting status response and verify full HTTP lifecycle event history without GET side effects; full solution/build then checkpoint. Provider contract remains pending; no provider assumptions.
- Exact slice SHA from git; checkpoint included in commit, no unfinished changes at commit. Usage last observed 77% short-window/66% weekly remaining.

## 2026-10-09 — HTTP acknowledgment evidence and final audit integration
- Retry audit committed/pushed as `6376466`.
- Compile-time RED for absent PostedAt response, then minimal result/handler projection GREEN. PostgreSQL HTTP lifecycle verifies null for Pending/scheduled, exact stored first time for Posted, all three audit kinds and immutable identities, and no audit writes on repeated GET.
- Focused HTTP test passed; final full solution 296 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. Unit read-only tests retain null for historical/domain-only Posted without fabricated timestamps.
- No additional migration. This closing slice is committed separately; exact SHA and remote/primary clean state recorded in workspace handoff after push.

## 2026-10-09 — provider request identity foundation
- Fresh local mirror, primary checkout and GitHub main all independently matched clean `45b663918b2bb818cf3128a161dc7a24032ce67c`. Baseline full solution 296 passed; build zero warnings/errors.
- User selected Stripe PaymentIntents; authoritative webhook completion, Infrastructure-only Stripe SDK, neutral application contract. Provider dependency is now resolved. Explicit accounting inputs/fees remain required; no frontend changes.
- Compile-time focused RED captured before adding immutable CreateProviderPaymentRequest. GREEN validates identity, positive minor-unit amount and ASCII currency code; normalizes currency and derives operation-scoped idempotency solely from payment ID. Same identity reuses its key; different identity differs. No caller override or rounding.
- Payments unit module 118 passed (8 added cases), zero failed/skipped; full solution build zero warnings/errors. Baseline evidence and focused RED/GREEN logs in /tmp/settlecore-*.log.
- Next: neutral IPaymentProvider/result/status boundary, then Stripe Infrastructure adapter tested with fake HTTP transport before application wiring and signed durable webhook ingestion. Creation must never mark local payment succeeded.
- Durable continuity is tracked PROJECT_CHECKPOINT.md and workspace SettleCore_HANDOFF.md; account-wide memory editing and automatic UI mode switching unavailable. Visible quota last observed 66% short-window/65% weekly remaining.

## 2026-10-09 — neutral provider contract
- Request foundation committed/pushed separately as `fe1dfaa`.
- Focused compile-time RED then GREEN for Payments-owned IPaymentProvider/CreateProviderPaymentResult/ProviderPaymentStatus. Result reuses neutral ProviderPaymentReference; nullable client secret is response data, not persisted or logged. Contract forwards cancellation and preserves local Pending status.
- Neutral statuses include processing, capture-required and canceled, avoiding premature success/failure assumptions. Requires-payment-method remains retryable Pending in the upcoming adapter; unknown provider statuses must fail explicitly.
- Payments unit module 119 passed; full build zero warnings/errors. No Infrastructure SDK dependency in Domain/Application.
- Next: pinned official Stripe.net SDK in Infrastructure, isolated transport RED tests for PaymentIntent payload/idempotency/metadata and status normalization, then minimal adapter GREEN. No live provider credentials required for those tests.

## 2026-10-09 — Stripe PaymentIntent adapter
- Neutral contract committed/pushed as `105107f`. Official Stripe.net 53.0.0 pinned exclusively in Payments Infrastructure.
- Focused compile-time RED then nine fake HTTP transport cases GREEN using the actual SDK. Adapter creates unconfirmed PaymentIntent with explicit amount/currency, payment-derived idempotency header and SettleCore identity metadata. No Connect routing/application fee assumptions. Provider reference/client secret returned neutrally; local status unchanged.
- All seven documented PaymentIntent statuses normalized; requires-payment-method/confirmation are Pending, processing/capture/action/canceled explicit, unknown status throws. A failed attempt does not make the retryable intent terminal.
- Full solution 314 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. No migration/frontend/live external provider calls. Current logs /tmp/settlecore-stripe-{red,green,full,build}.log.
- Next: authenticated webhook decoder with explicit secret, clock/tolerance/API-version checks and neutral event data, then durable inbox and explicit posting-input preparation before authoritative success application.
- Quota last observed 52% short-window/62% weekly remaining; no automatic mode switch or account-wide memory tool available.

## 2026-10-09 — authenticated Stripe success decoder
- PaymentIntent adapter committed/pushed as `f4aed62`; full solution 314 passed.
- Focused compile-time RED and malformed signed-envelope behavioral RED captured, then GREEN for neutral webhook decoder/evidence/exception boundary. Official SDK authenticates exact raw body, positive explicit replay tolerance with injected clock, compatible API version. HMAC tests cover tampering/wrong secret/invalid header/expired and future timestamps.
- Only signed payment_intent.succeeded returns neutral evidence; unrelated events ignored after authentication. Rejects inconsistent status, absent/empty metadata identity, incomplete amount received, malformed envelopes and incompatible API versions. Event carries provider/event/payment IDs, exact amount/currency, occurrence time and live-mode flag, no raw sensitive payload/client secret.
- Payments Infrastructure 66 passed (19 new decoder cases); solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 314 before this slice; repeat after inbox migration. No HTTP connection or local status write yet.
- Next: PostgreSQL durable event inbox with provider/event identity deduplication, conflicting replay rejection, first receipt time and concurrent delivery tests; store before any acknowledgment. Correlate against durable local provider reference and amount before applying success. Explicit posting-input preparation still needed; never infer accounts or fees.
- Quota last observed 47% short-window/61% weekly remaining; tracked checkpoints and workspace handoff provide durable continuity.

## 2026-10-09 — durable provider success inbox
- Focused compile-time RED then four PostgreSQL cases GREEN: preserve first receipt, identical retries, differing evidence conflict, concurrent identical deliveries and provider-scoped event IDs.
- Additive migration `20261009033110_AddPaymentProviderEventInbox` stores neutral evidence and timestamps with composite provider/event identity and pending index. Receipt can arrive before local payment/reference persistence; no FK silently rejects that recoverable timing. No raw payload or client secret stored.
- Single parameterized INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING followed by independent evidence comparison protects replay without poisoning EF tracking. Conflicting amount/identity/currency/reference/mode/time leaves original unchanged. Payment completion/ProcessedAt remain untouched.
- Full solution 337 passed, zero failed/skipped; build zero warnings/errors. Migration reviewed additive only. Evidence copied to workspace settlecore-evidence/2026-10-09-stripe.
- Next: configuration/DI then durable signed HTTP ingestion. Processing must verify stored local reference, amount/currency/mode and explicit posting inputs; do not infer any accounting routing or fees.

## 2026-10-09 — validated opt-in Stripe composition
- Inbox committed/pushed as `5e35891`; full solution 337 passed.
- Focused compile-time RED then seven host startup/DI GREEN cases. Payments:Stripe settings default disabled; enabled mode requires explicit API key, webhook secret, positive SignatureToleranceSeconds and nullable IsLiveMode selection. No secrets added to appsettings or repository.
- Runtime validated options govern lazy adapter construction; disabled mode refuses provider/decoder resolution. No SDK global state or outbound request on startup. Inbox scoped, provider/decoder singleton, injected TimeProvider.
- Host integration module 86 passed, zero failed/skipped; full solution build zero warnings/errors. Last full solution 337 before seven new configuration tests.
- Next: opt-in POST /payments/webhooks/stripe receives exact raw body/signature, enforces configured live/test mode and persists authenticated evidence before 200; invalid signatures/mode 400, conflicting replay 409, storage failure must not acknowledge success. No payment success changes until explicit posting-input preparation/correlation.
