# SettleCore checkpoint — 2026-09-27

## Current position
- Active repository: `/Users/suthankan/Desktop/Projects/SettleCore`, branch `main`.
- 011.3C committed/pushed as `6f247da`: Ledger handler registration and Payments-owned port adapter DI.
- 011.4A committed/pushed as `baafb06`: exact positive decimal-to-long minor units with explicit precision; no rounding.
- 011.4B already committed/pushed as `77b3221` when this session started: Payments currency policy supports SGD=2, JPY=0, KWD=3, case normalization, no fallback.
- 011.4C committed/pushed as `6413d63`: `PaymentAmountConversion.ToMinorUnits(decimal, string)` composes the currency policy and exact converter. 16 new tests cover precision, lowercase, fractional units, invalid currency, null, nonpositive and overflow amounts.

- 011.5A committed/pushed as `957787b`: Ledger repository treats matching transaction IDs/ledger/entry multisets as idempotent; different contents throw LedgerTransactionConflictException. PostgreSQL unique-key races reload the winner and detach the failed insert. No schema change.

- 011.5B (this checkpoint-containing commit): ledger HTTP endpoint returns 409 on conflicting transaction identity; identical retries retain the existing 201/location response without duplicate writes.

## Verification
- 011.4B baseline: 205 solution tests passed.
- 011.4C: compile-time RED confirmed; then 221 solution tests passed, zero failures/skips, including PostgreSQL Testcontainers. Full solution build: zero warnings/errors.

- 011.5A: four PostgreSQL RED tests then GREEN, including deterministic concurrent writers, reversed entry order, same-context repeats, conflicts and context reuse. Full solution: 225 passed, no failures/skips; build zero warnings/errors.

- 011.5B: PostgreSQL HTTP test RED (500 instead of 409), then full solution 226 passed, zero failures/skips. Build zero warnings/errors; diff check clean.

## Architecture and next slices
- Preserve .NET 10/C#14 modular monolith, Minimal APIs, module-owned DI and EF/PostgreSQL. Backend and tests before frontend/deployment.
- Payments owns IPaymentLedgerPostingPort and PaymentLedgerPostingRequest; Payments Infrastructure adapts to Ledger PostPaymentLedgerTransactionHandler.
- Payment.Amount remains decimal; Ledger uses integer minor units. Currency-aware conversion is available but success integration remains unwired.
- MarkPaymentSucceededCommand carries only PaymentId; handler marks/saves status only. Accounting routing and authoritative fee source are not defined. Do not invent either.
- USER DECISION CONFIRMED 2026-09-27: require explicit posting inputs from the caller (ledger/account routing and exact fee); do not invent merchant configuration or fee formulas.
- Next intended slice 011.6A: model explicit payment-success posting inputs and build a Payments-owned posting request from stored Payment.Amount/Currency using the currency-aware converter. Include stable caller-supplied TransactionId, LedgerId, the three account IDs and an explicitly unit-labelled fee. Validate without writing or changing payment status. Follow existing Ledger fee constraints; any change to zero-fee support is separate scope.
- Then add durable Payments-owned posting intent, uniquely keyed by payment, storing the complete immutable payload and stable transaction ID atomically with status in the Payments database. Add PostgreSQL rollback and concurrent retry/conflict tests before changing the success endpoint. Existing status-only handler must not call Ledger directly.
- After atomic success/intent persistence is verified, add dispatch/retry/completion semantics through IPaymentLedgerPostingPort. Ledger idempotency now handles matching/conflicting concurrent identities; protect against differing payloads for the same payment even when callers supply different transaction IDs.
- Repository retry protection is tested for current standalone SaveChanges usage. If wrapping Ledger writes in an explicit transaction later, verify isolation/savepoint recovery separately.
- Define durable posting intent together with success persistence before connecting stores; no independent status/posting writes.
- Remaining backend: payment-ledger integration, audit, provider ingestion, webhooks, workers/outbox/idempotency, observability. No frontend work performed.

## Commit and continuity
- User authorizes commit/push after each logical green slice to `https://github.com/Suthankan1/SettleCore.git`.
- Remote main pushed at `957787b` before 011.5B. This commit contains 011.5B and checkpoint; use git log for final hash.
- Current handback threshold: around 10% remaining, superseding 4%. Last observed: 14% short-window and 87% weekly remaining.
- Original chat: `6ab2b1a8-08b4-83ee-b497-fa1440530122` (C# .NET Project Idea).

## Handoff
- Autonomous work stopping at the verified 011.5B boundary near the capacity threshold; no uncommitted implementation work intended. Verify local HEAD/remote match after push.
- Completed this run: 011.4C `6413d63`, 011.5A `957787b`, and 011.5B (checkpoint-containing commit). 011.4B `77b3221` was already present and pushed.
- No payment-success-to-ledger wiring, outbox worker, provider ingestion, audit or frontend implementation added in this run.
